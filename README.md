MarioAgent
==========

A Super Mario World Game-Playing Agent. The agent was developed as a final project for an Artificial Intelligence course I took in college.

It runs in the MarioAI framework available at http://www.marioai.org/home

The code provided here is my original submission for the class and requires the framework to run. It implements a greedy Astar search to find the best path to the end of the vision of the agent. It creates a set of actions, estimates their value according to distance from goal and hazards encountered along the way, and then uses Astar to find the most valuable path.
